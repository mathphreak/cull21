## CONCEPT
Choices are good, but too many choices are frustrating (paradox of choice?).
Given a pool, randomly pick two and let the user decide on one.

## NAME
Came up with some ideas, settled on Cull21 (Cull To One, since it's culling your pool of options down to one)

## PALETTE
Coolors kicks butt. Spammed random for a while, got a purple I liked, iterated down until I liked [the palette](https://coolors.co/d2cca1-387780-dbd4d3-e83151-735193).

* `#​D2CCA1`
* `#​387780`
* `#​DBD4D3`
* `#​E83151`
* `#​735193`

## LOGO
I whipped up [a thing](https://www.figma.com/file/dPqtALFRjloPTlgYle0anyDj/Logo) in Figma because I can't necessarily run Inkscape on my Chromebook very effectively.
For type, I just somewhat arbitrarily picked Rubik off Google Fonts.

## STACK
I wound up choosing Sinatra because Rails wasn't getting me anywhere.
